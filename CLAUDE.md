# CLAUDE.md — Frontend Website Rules

## Use the vercel-react-best-practices skill
- npx skills add https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill vercel-react-best-practices

## Tech Stack
- Astro for the front end
- hosted on Vercel
- domain name already purchased from Vercel: dereklopez.dev

## Local Server
- **Always serve on localhost before pushing to Git** — never screenshot a `file:///` URL.
- Start the dev server: `node serve.mjs` (serves the project root at `http://localhost:3000`)
- `serve.mjs` lives in the project root. Start it in the background before taking any screenshots.
- If the server is already running, do not start a second instance.

## Output Defaults
- Single `index.html` file, all styles inline, unless user says otherwise
- Tailwind CSS via CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- Placeholder images: `https://placehold.co/WIDTHxHEIGHT`
- Mobile-first responsive

## Anti-Generic Guardrails
- **Colors:** Never use default Tailwind palette (indigo-500, blue-600, etc.). Pick a custom brand color and derive from it.
- **Shadows:** Never use flat `shadow-md`. Use layered, color-tinted shadows with low opacity.
- **Typography:** Never use the same font for headings and body. Pair a display/serif with a clean sans. Apply tight tracking (`-0.03em`) on large headings, generous line-height (`1.7`) on body.
- **Gradients:** Layer multiple radial gradients. Add grain/texture via SVG noise filter for depth.
- **Animations:** Only animate `transform` and `opacity`. Never `transition-all`. Use spring-style easing.
- **Interactive states:** Every clickable element needs hover, focus-visible, and active states. No exceptions.
- **Images:** Add a gradient overlay (`bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60`) and a color treatment layer with `mix-blend-multiply`.
- **Spacing:** Use intentional, consistent spacing tokens — not random Tailwind steps.
- **Depth:** Surfaces should have a layering system (base → elevated → floating), not all sit at the same z-plane.

## Hard Rules
- Do not add sections, features, or content not in the reference
- Do not "improve" a reference design — match it
- Do not use `transition-all`
- Do not use default Tailwind blue/indigo as primary color
- Always verify dev server is running Next.js (not static) and that required env vars (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, Supabase) are set before debugging runtime bugs.
- Add under ## Project Structure\n\nPlace brand/static assets in public/brand_assets/ (not root) and copy manifest.json into dist/ in webpack config for extension builds.
